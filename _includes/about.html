                <br/>

                <p class="being-a-nerd">Hello, World! My name is Nancy Tao.</p><br/>

                <p>
                I'm a second year <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/">computer science</a> student at Georgia Tech with concentrations in <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/intelligence">intelligence</a> and <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/information-internetworks">information internetworks</a>. I'm particularly interested in natural language processing and information security. Currently, I'm spending my extra time working for <a href="https://security.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech's OIT Cyber Security department</a>, doing research in Dr. Eric Gilbert's <a href="http://comp.social.gatech.edu/">social computing lab</a>, and being a teaching assistant for Georgia Tech's freshmen seminar, CS 1100.

                <br/><br/>
                Outside of the technical stuff, I also geek out about (in no particular order)

                <br/><br/>
                I also had the amazing opportunity to study abroad this past summer in Barcelona, which was an absolutely incredible experience!

                <br/><br/>
                While I have a lot of ideas, I'm not sure yet what I want to do with my life. However, I know it's going to be an amazing ride, so join me!
